# Progress Infos for Back-end

## What is implemented

* Maven skeleton for Spring-Boot projects 
* Spring JPA for mapping DB Entities
* CORS policy to accept cross site requests
* H2 In-Memory Database service
* Repositories for persisting object
* ObjectMapper to convert String to Json format and store to DB

## What is missing

* Validate input Json object
* Get REST to retrieve saved schema (as well as all CRUD operations) 
* Authentication/Authorization (maybe a bit out of scope but since it is mentioned in requirements so I just put it here)
