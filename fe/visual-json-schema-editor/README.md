# Progress Infos for Front-end

## What is implemented

* Layouts with separated sections and css styling for each individual component
 
* React Hooks methods for components

* Drag and Drop behaviors using react-dnd with HTML 5 backend 

* Connect to Redux store for state management

* API utils using axios to communicate with server

* Using material-ui for messaging components. They are having issue with React 18 and will release a patch soon, for now we are using legacy code which will generate warning while running the app.

* JsonUtils with logics to recursively add nodes and generate schema (still buggy atm).

* Refine how schema tree organised to be able to add 2nd level of props

* Removing node function by clicking onto type icon

## What is missing

 *Rules to drag and drop to tree schema. I created utils/Constants.js for rules configuration.
 
 *ACTUS types. If we can have the skeleton for Json Schema implemented properly, I reackon this will be a quick job
